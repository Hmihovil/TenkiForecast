# Tenki Forecast

This is An Android App written in Kotlin for educational purposes, it isn't complete yet but you're able to fetch data from OpenWeatherMap API without much issues, you can change the location via google map by holding the location buttons found above correspondingly.

I will be continuing the development of this project shortly, hopefully if I have enough time for it.

Here are a couple screenshots of the App in action:

Several libraries have been used to make this, you can check them out over gradle.

Code will be cleaned and refactored as I progress with the updates.

Have fun.
