# TenkiForecast

This is An Android App written in Kotlin for educational purposes, it isn't yet complete but you're able to fetch data from OpenWeatherMap API without much issues.

I will be continuing the development of this app shortly if I have enough time for it.

Here are a couple screenshots of the App in action:

Several libraries have been used to make this, you can check them out over gradle.

Code will be cleaned as I progress with the updates.

Have fun.
